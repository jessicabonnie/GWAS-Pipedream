zCall is used to call only "rare" SNPs, thus, the "zCalled" plink file produced at the end of this script contains the data from another plink file, a raw plink file used during initial QC, which was created from from a full data export from Genome Studio in "Top Allele" format. This un-zCalled raw plink file, which is passed to the script, fills in the genotype information for all but the rare (MAF < 1%) SNPs with call rates of greater than 99%. The rare SNPs with MAF < 99% and call rate > 99% are recalled by zCall.

Here are the calls, it is recommended that you run this script while in a tempdata directory:
bash zCall_master.sh 
	This will produce the "zcallreport_QCed.txt" and the "BETAS.txt" that are needed as arguments to zCallibrationLoop.sh

bash zCalibrationLoop.sh zcallreport_QCed.txt BETAS.txt 


I. Prepare data for zCall and Select "Rare" SNPs (zCall_master.sh)

	Step 1. QC Raw Report for Feeding Into Zcall
		A. Take out known bad samples  -- samplestoberemoved provided after Initial QC
		B. Apply Subject Callrate Filter (%98)
		C. Compare Number of Subjects, Before and After
		D. Zip Up intermediate QC report
	
	
	Step 2. Calculate Mean & Standard Deviations for each Homozygote Cluster (NOTE: zCall has built in MAF and Call Rate filters)


	Step 3. Create Rare SNP Lists using un-zCalled raw plink files from "Top Allele" format data export (those used by Wei-Min in Initial QC)

		A. Calculate Minor Allele Frequency and SNP missingness -- removing samplestoberemoved provided after Initial QC
		B. Create List of Rare (MAF>1%) SNPs with Callrates of 99% or Greater

	Step 4. Create Allele and Flipping Update Files from Manifest
		A. Identify correct manifest files based on chip version
		B. Create File to Update Illumina Alleles (A/B) to ATCG
		C. Create Master File to from which to select TOP Illumina Allele Updates Later
	
	
	Step 5. EXCLUDE RARE SNPs (MAF < 1% & Call Rate > 99%) from un-zCalled Raw PLINK Files -- "raw_excluderare99"

	Step 6. Create Update Files from Raw PLINK File
		A. updatesex.txt
		B. updatefamily.txt
		C. updateparents.txt
		D. updatestatus.txt

		
II. zCall all SNPs with zCall's Built-In Thresholds (zCall_master.sh cont.)
	
	Step 1. Recalculate BETAs using ../MEAN.SD file
	
	Step 2. Recalculate Thresholds
	
	Step 3. Recall all NoCalls using these Thresholds
	
	Step 4. Convert File to PLINK Bim/Bed Format -- Keeping only RARE SNPs

	Step 5. Update Phenotype Info
		A. updatesex.txt
		B. updatefamily.txt
		C. updateparents.txt
		D. updatestatus.txt

	Step 6. Update Alleles (A/B to ACTG)

	Step 7. Flip Certain Rare SNPs to return to TOP ALLELE format
		
		A. Run frequency test on zCalled data -- RARE SNPs only.
		B. Check A2 Values of Rare SNPs Match between un-zCalled and zCalled frequency files
		C. Flip ONLY those Rare SNPS whose A2 values DO NOT MATCH value in un-zCalled TOP ALLELE Frequency File
	
	Step 8. Merge zCalled Rare SNPs with Subset of unZCalled raw (from which rare SNPs have been EXCLUDED) 
	
	Step 8. Run Threshold and Calibration Checking Loop
	
III. Run Threshold and Calibration Checking (zCallibrationLoop.sh)

	Step 1. Calibrate Z Values between 3 and 15
	
	Step 2. Calculate the accuracy of Z values
