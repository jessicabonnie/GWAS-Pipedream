I. Top Level Folder - zCall
	Step 1. QC Raw Report for Feeding Into Zcall
		A. Take out known bad samples
		B. Apply Subject Callrate Filter (%98)
		C. Compare Number of Subjects, Before and After
		D. Zip Up intermediate QC report
	
	
	Step 2. Calculate Mean & Standard Deviations for each Homozygote Cluster (NOTE: zCall has built in MAF and Call Rate filters)


	Step 3. Create Common (1) and Rare (3) SNP Lists using raw plink files (those used by Wei-Min in Initial QC)

		A. Calculate Minor Allele Frequency in Raw Samples
		B. Calculate Missingness in Raw Samples
		C. Create Merged Table
		D. Create List of Common SNPs (MAF>1%) with call rate greater than 98%
		E. Create Three Lists of Rare (MAF>1%) SNPs with Callrates of 97%,98%,99%

	Step 4. Create Allele and Flipping Update Files from Manifest
		A. Identify correct manifest files based on chip version
		B. Create File to Update Illumina Alleles (A/B) to ATCG
		C. Create File to Set TOP Illumina Allele
	
	Step 5. EXTRACT COMMON SNPs from Raw PLINK Files
		A. raw_extractcommon
	
	Step 6. EXCLUDE RARE SNPs from Raw PLINK Files (for all three Rare Lists)
		A. raw_removerare97
		B. raw_removerare98
		C. raw_removerare99

	Step 7. Create Update Files from Raw PLINK File
		A. updatesex.txt
		B. updatefamily.txt
		C. updateparents.txt
	
II. Daughter Directory #1 - commonThresholds
	Step 1. Subset ../MEAN.SD.txt (CREATED IN I.Step2) using the common SNP list
	
	Step 2. Recalculate BETAs using Subsetted MEAN.SD file
	
	Step 3. Recalculate Thresholds
	
	Step 4. Recall all NoCalls using these Thresholds
	
	Step 5. Convert File to PLINK Bim/Bed Format and Update Phenotype Info
	
	Step 6. Update Alleles and Flipping
	
	Step 7. EXTRACT RARE lists from zCalled PLINK FILES for ALL THREE RARE LISTS
		A. zcall_rare97
		B. zcall_rare98
		C. zcall_rare99
	
	
	Step 8. Create Results from EXTRACTING RARES from zCall and EXTRACTING COMMONS from raw ---> Grandaughter Directory Type 2 
	
	Step 9. Create Results from EXTRACTING RARES from zCall and EXCLUDING RARES from raw ---> Grandaughter Directory Type 3 
	
	Step 10. Run Threshold and Calibration Checking Loop -----> Granddaughter Directory Type 1
		
III. Daughter Directory #2 - basicThresholds
	
	Step 1. Recalculate BETAs using ../MEAN.SD file
	
	Step 2. Recalculate Thresholds
	
	Step 3. Recall all NoCalls using these Thresholds
	
	Step 4. Convert File to PLINK Bim/Bed Format and Update Phenotype Info
	
	Step 5. Update Alleles and Flipping
	
	Step 6. EXTRACT RARE lists from zCalled PLINK FILES for ALL THREE RARE LISTS
		A. zcall_rare97
		B. zcall_rare98
		C. zcall_rare99
	
	Step 7. Create Results from EXTRACTING RARES from zCall and EXTRACTING COMMONS from raw ---> Grandaughter Directory Type 2 
	
	Step 8. Create Results from EXTRACTING RARES from zCall and EXCLUDING RARES from raw ---> Grandaughter Directory Type 3 
	
	Step 9. Run Threshold and Calibration Checking Loop -----> Granddaughter Directory Type 1
	
IV. Granddaughter Directory Type 1 -----> "threshold_calibration_checking"

	Step 1. Calibrating Z Values between 3 and 15
	
	Step 2. Calculating the accuracy of Z values
	
V. Granddaughter Directory Type 2 ----> "extractRare_extractCommon"

	Step 1. Merge ../zcall_rare* for each RARE category with ../../raw_extractcommon
	
	
VI. Granddaughter Directory Type 3 ----> "extractRare_excludeRare"

	Step 1. Merge ../zcall_rare* for each RARE category with ../../raw_excluderare
